# Overview of dati.terna.it Data

The **dati.terna.it** platform, managed by Terna S.p.A., Italy’s main electricity Transmission System Operator (TSO), provides transparent and accessible **real-time and historical data** on Italy’s electricity system. It includes interactive charts, downloadable tables, and dashboards covering production, consumption, and grid operations from 2000 onward. Key sections include Load, Generation, Transmission, Market, System Adequacy, Fees, and Statistics. Users can filter by time, region, or energy source and export data in Excel or tabular formats via the **Download Center**.

Below is an explanation of the **Load**, **Generation**, and **Transmission** sections, including how to interpret the data and the main units of measurement, followed by an overview of Terna S.p.A. and its data collection process.

## Load
- **Definition**: "Load" represents the **total electricity consumption** in Italy, aggregating demand from households, industries, and businesses. It includes the market load (free market demand) and peak values (daily/seasonal highs and lows), indicating grid stress periods.
- **How to Read the Data**: Line charts show hourly/daily consumption trends, while tables provide numerical values. For example, summer peaks may reflect air conditioning use. Use filters to compare historical trends (e.g., rising demand due to electrification).
- **Units of Measurement**:
  - **MW (Megawatt)**: Instantaneous power demand (e.g., peak demand in a specific hour).
  - **GWh (Gigawatt-hour)**: Total energy consumed over a period (e.g., daily total).
  - Example: A load of 50,000 MW indicates peak power demand at a given moment; 1,200 GWh is the total energy consumed in a day.

## Generation
- **Definition**: Covers **electricity production** fed into the grid from thermal, renewable (wind, solar, hydro), and other sources. It includes installed capacity (available power) and energy balance (net production, import/export).
- **How to Read the Data**: Pie or bar charts show the distribution by source (e.g., % renewables), while line graphs display hourly production. The energy balance table equates production + imports - exports = consumption. Filter by source to analyze trends, like higher solar output in summer.
- **Units of Measurement**:
  - **MW**: Installed capacity by source (e.g., 20,000 MW from wind).
  - **GWh**: Energy produced over a period (e.g., 500 GWh from solar in a month).
  - Example: A 10 GW capacity means the system can generate up to 10,000 MW; annual production is ~300 TWh for Italy.

## Transmission
- **Definition**: Refers to the **transport of electricity** through the high-voltage grid (from power plants to local distributors), including flows, grid congestion, and international interconnections. It ensures grid stability to prevent blackouts.
- **How to Read the Data**: Interactive maps display grid flows (e.g., red for overload), while charts show transmission losses (typically 2-5% of energy). Tables detail cross-border exchanges (e.g., with France or Slovenia).
- **Units of Measurement**:
  - **MW**: Power flow on the grid (e.g., 1,000 MW exported).
  - **GWh**: Energy transmitted over a period (e.g., monthly total).
  - Example: 10 GWh in losses indicates energy dissipated due to cable resistance; a 5,000 MW flow is the instantaneous transfer.

**General Note**: Data is historical (from 2000) and often real-time, updated hourly or daily. Use chart zooms for details. Units follow ISO standards (1 MW = 1 million watts; 1 GWh = 1 billion watt-hours). Low values reflect national aggregates.

## About Terna S.p.A.

**Terna S.p.A.** is Italy’s leading TSO, managing the high-voltage electricity grid (380-220 kV) with ~75,000 km of lines, one of Europe’s largest and most advanced networks. Established in 1999 as an Enel spin-off, Terna operates as a regulated monopoly under Italy’s energy authority (ARERA). Its core role is to **ensure safe and reliable electricity transmission**, balancing supply and demand in real-time (dispatching). Terna supports the energy transition by integrating renewables and international interconnections and invests in smart grids and storage solutions.

**Data Collection**: Terna gathers data from over 4,500 operators (producers, distributors, importers) via real-time telemetry, grid sensors, and mandatory reports. These "big data" are analyzed to monitor the system and prevent risks. Data is published on **dati.terna.it** for transparency, as required by EU and Italian regulations, with frequent updates and audits for accuracy. The data, sourced from direct measurements and certified reports, is reliable and freely accessible for market analysis and energy policy.
